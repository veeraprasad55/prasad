GIT --> version control tool used to keep track of versions of files and directories..

mkdir git_practice
cd git_practice

git init ---> create git repo
(ls -a and make sure .git repo is present)

-------------------------------------------------------
git config --global user.name "abc"
git config --global user.email "abc@gmail.com"
--------------------------------------------------------------------
vi file1

(add two lines )

git status 
(untracked files )

git add file1 --> move files from local repo to index area 

git status
git commit -m "added file1" ---> this will move files from index area to git repo.

git status
(nothing to commit, working tree clean)

git log ---> shows history of repository

git log -2 --> shows you latest two commits 

git log filename ---> shows you all commits on a file

git log -2 filename ---> latest two commits on a file


vi file1
(add extra few lines to it)

git add file1
git commit -m "modified file1"

git log 
(u can see two commits)

take previous commit ID 

git checkout Prev-Commit-ID ---> used to switch to previous commit or switch to branch or switch to tag

cat file1
(check content of a file)

git checkout master  
(switch to latest commit)

git log 

(u can see all commits)

u can add one more file test and repeat above steps 
-----------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Branch ---> its for parallel development, two people or two team work on the same piece of code for developing different set of features.
and intergrate them by merging.

git branch  ---> list branches

git branch branch1 ---> create branch from checked out branch

git branch branch2 branch1  --> create branch2 from branch1

how to delete branch

git branch -d branchname 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
steps to pratice
git branch branch1  ---> create branch1 from master

git checkout branch1 ---> switch to branch1

add new file in this branch

git checkout master --> go to master branch

git merge branch1  ---> branch1 will get merged to master

create another branch branch2..
modify the same piece of code on two different branches... and try to merge .. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

-------------explain merge conflict--------------- 
Merging Conflict Will occur when the same peace of code is changed on 2 
different branches, when we try to merge those two brnaches, 
then merging conflict will occur,
 To resolve this issue, I don‘t know whose change should I take 
to merge , so I contact developers changes the code, person 
who modified code of branch1 and branch2. Then they will 
decide and tell us whose changes should I take into merge. Then I take that change and I commit it. I get to know who 
modified the code on branch1 and branch2 using git log 
command.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

git tag---> tag is name given to set of versions of files. Its easy to remember in future and it indicates milestone of a project.

git tag --> list tags

git tag tagname --> create tag. tag the latest versions of all files

git tag -d tagname --> delete tag

how do you create branch from tag?

git branch branch-name tagname 

how do create branch and checkout automatically?

git checkout -b branch5 branch1  ---> create branch and switch to new branch 
=================================================================================================



git stash :

if you are working on one branch, in between if you get any critical which needs to be fixed on another branch.
in this case, before I switch to another branch, we need to stash it from current branch (stash will store it in temprory area). After completing work on another branch.
switch it to back to current branch and get stashed changes using git stash pop.

create some files
git add *
git stash 
git checkout branch
after completing critical work another branch switch it back to current branch
git checkout current-brach
git stash pop
git reset HEAD
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

how do merge particular change or specific commit to branch??

git cherry-pick commitID

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

git rebase ---> it's nothing but merge. one branch will get added to tip of another branch.
you can squash and merge it to another branch.


git rebase branch

diff between merge and rebase
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

how do you squash (combine multiple commits) commits?

git rebase -i HEAD~4  

(it will squash latest 4 commits )

s or squash --> squash
p or pick ---> it will retain that commit 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Git clone
Bringing the remote repo to local workspace for the first time 
called as git clone.
Git clone user@servername: /home/path/central_repo/

Git push
Moving the changes from workspace to remote repo or central 
repo
 Git push user@severname: /path.././central_repo

Git pull
Bring the changes from remote repository and merges to local 
repo automatically.
Git pull user@servername: /home/./path/central_repo

fetch
Bring the changes from remote repo and stores it on a separate 
branch, you can review the changes and merge it to local repo if it is 
required.
Git fetch user@servername:/home.//./central_repo/

Git pull = git fetch + git merge

I am not able to push code to central repo. what is the reason?
other developer might have changed the same line of code in different way and push already. 
so if I am trying to push to central repo, I will not able to push.
in this case, I need to pull it and merge conflict will occur in the local workspace, resolve it,push it back to central repo.

you should pull source code to local repo and resolve merge conflicts if any. then push it to central repo

=============================================================================================================================================

bare repo:

its central repo. we can push and pull code. we can't run any git operations here
git init --bare

-------------------------------------------------------------------

non-bare: it's local repo where we can run all git operations. 
when we clone central repo to workspace. it becomes local repo automatically
git init
